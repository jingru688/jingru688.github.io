Highlights
• We find significant correlations between access to WASH and women's intrinsic and instrumental agency.
• This correlation is stronger in Zambia than Honduras, highlighting that relationships are spatially heterogeneous.
• Treating water is correlated with women's perceived self-efficacy and women's input into agricultural production decisions.
