This study investigates how accessibility to SNAP-authorized retailers influences household food purchasing behavior among SNAP participants. Using a dynamic panel model and an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) framework, we examine how changes in the local food retail environment measured by new openings and closures of SNAP-authorized stores, affect household spending across food categories. Our analysis finds that increased access to SNAP retailers, especially convenience stores, leads to significant rises in household food expenditures, particularly in dry grocery and frozen foods, while retailer closures have minimal impact due to household adaptation. These findings reveal that consumer spending patterns are highly responsive to improvements in food access, with convenience store openings playing a pivotal role in shaping dietary consumption among low-income households. The results provide new insights for policymakers seeking to improve food security and nutritional outcomes through strategic expansion of SNAP retailer networks.
